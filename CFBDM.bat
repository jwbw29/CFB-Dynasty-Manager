REM replace folder_path with your actual folder path. ( ex. "C:\Users\kn1meR\Desktop\CFB-Dynasty-Manager-v2026" )
REM the setup for me would look like this.  replace my folder path with yours!
REM cd "C:\Users\kn1meR\Desktop\CFB-Dynasty-Manager-v2026"
REM npm run electron-dev

cd <folder_path>
npm run electron-dev
